# School Notification Management
I have developed a school management project in C# using visual programming, which focuses on managing and distributing school notifications effectively 📢. This project aims to streamline the communication process between the school administration, teachers, and students 📚.

The system features a user-friendly interface that allows administrators to create and send notifications regarding important events, announcements, and updates 📅. These notifications can be categorized and scheduled for specific dates and times, ensuring timely delivery to the intended recipients ⏰. Teachers can also access the system to post class-specific notifications, assignments, and exam schedules 📝.

The project incorporates various functionalities to enhance usability and efficiency, such as:

1) User Authentication 🔒: Secure login for administrators, teachers, and students to ensure data privacy.
2) Dashboard 🖥️: A comprehensive dashboard displaying recent notifications, upcoming events, and quick access to important features.
3) Notification Management 📨: Tools for creating, editing, and scheduling notifications with options for attaching files and setting priorities.
4) Distribution Lists 📋: Customizable lists to target specific groups of students or staff members.
5) History and Archives 🗂️: A repository of past notifications for record-keeping and reference.
